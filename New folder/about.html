                   <small>I was a<s> herion addict</s> for 14 years</small>
                   I made it out alive only by the <mark>grace of God.</mark> I have been making comedy skits on video since I was a kid
                   and now I do all the videography for the church I attend and Lifeline connect residential treatment center. 
                   I went to visual and performing arts high school and forest park college in videography and fine arts. I play guitar 
                   and make beats, I try to sing but <q>I am not very good at it. Oh well its still fun.</q> I was in a couple punk bands as a 
                   kid and a metal band in my mid 20s. Im 35 years old but act alot younger.
